# Tasks:
  
**1. Load and clean FacultySalaries_1995.csv file and Re-create the graph below...**

```{r, echo=FALSE, fig.align='center',fig.width=5,fig.height=5}
knitr::include_graphics("./Fig1.png")
```


# Loading R programs
```{r Loading, echo=TRUE, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
library(readr)
library(tidyverse)
library(janitor)
library(easystats)
library(ggplot2)

```
# Reading in the data
```{r results=FALSE}
df <- read_csv("FacultySalaries_1995.csv")

```

After looking at the data and the graph that we are supposed to produce I decide that I'll need new column with the college rank of "assoc" "assist"
or "full" and then facet wrap by tier(exluding VIIB) where x is the new column and y is the salaries for each one so I need to make a new salary column as well.

```{r echo=TRUE}
salary <- df %>%
  select(ends_with(c("Salary","ID","Name","State","Tier")))
salary <- salary %>%
  pivot_longer(c(AvgFullProfSalary,AvgAssocProfSalary,AvgAssistProfSalary),
               names_to = "Rank",values_to = "Salary")%>% 
  mutate(Rank = Rank %>% str_remove("ProfSalary"))%>%
  mutate(Rank = Rank %>% str_remove("Avg"))
```

Lets take a look to see if it worked
```{r}
salary
```
Great now I can make the plot, at first I didn't have the colors right compared to the example or a minimal theme and accidentally included
tier VIIB but I got there eventually.

```{r results=FALSE, message=FALSE}
df<- df %>% full_join(salary)
```
To get rid of tier VIIB
```{r results=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
selected_tiers <- c("I", "IIA", "IIB")
```
Then filter the data to include only those categories
```{r results=FALSE}
df <- df[df$Tier %in% selected_tiers, ]
```

# Now I have the right columns to be able to make the plot 
```{r plot, warning=FALSE}
x_colors <- c("#FF9999", "#99FF99", "#9999FF")
ggplot(df, aes(x=Rank,y=Salary,fill=Rank)) +
  geom_boxplot()+
  facet_wrap(~Tier)+
  scale_fill_manual(values = x_colors)+
  theme_minimal()
```


**2. Build an ANOVA model and display the summary output in your report.**
To build an anova model I simply used the code below
```{r echo=TRUE}
model <- aov(Salary ~ State + Rank + Tier, data = df)
# Print the ANOVA results
summary(model)
```


**3. The rest of the test uses another data set. The "Juniper_Oils.csv" data. Get it loaded and take a look. Then tidy it! (show the code used for tidying in your report)**
