# Tasks:
  
**1. Load and clean FacultySalaries_1995.csv file and Re-create the graph below...**

```{r, echo=FALSE, fig.align='center',fig.width=5,fig.height=5}
knitr::include_graphics("./Fig1.png")
```


# Loading R programs
```{r Loading, echo=TRUE, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
library(readr)
library(tidyverse)
library(janitor)
library(easystats)
library(ggplot2)
library(broom)

```
# Reading in the data
```{r results=FALSE}
df <- read_csv("FacultySalaries_1995.csv")

```

After looking at the data and the graph that we are supposed to produce I decide that I'll need new column with the college rank of "assoc" "assist"
or "full" and then facet wrap by tier(exluding VIIB) where x is the new column and y is the salaries for each one so I need to make a new salary column as well.

```{r echo=TRUE}
salary <- df %>%
  select(ends_with(c("Salary","ID","Name","State","Tier")))
salary <- salary %>%
  pivot_longer(c(AvgFullProfSalary,AvgAssocProfSalary,AvgAssistProfSalary),
               names_to = "Rank",values_to = "Salary")%>% 
  mutate(Rank = Rank %>% str_remove("ProfSalary"))%>%
  mutate(Rank = Rank %>% str_remove("Avg"))
```

Lets take a look to see if it worked
```{r}
salary
```
Great now I can make the plot, at first I didn't have the colors right compared to the example or a minimal theme and accidentally included
tier VIIB but I got there eventually.

```{r results=FALSE, message=FALSE}
df<- df %>% full_join(salary)
```
To get rid of tier VIIB
```{r results=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
selected_tiers <- c("I", "IIA", "IIB")
```
Then filter the data to include only those categories and plot
```{r results=FALSE}
df <- df[df$Tier %in% selected_tiers, ]
```

# First Plot

```{r plot, warning=FALSE}
x_colors <- c("#FF9999", "#99FF99", "#9999FF")
ggplot(df, aes(x=Rank,y=Salary,fill=Rank)) +
  geom_boxplot()+
  facet_wrap(~Tier)+
  scale_fill_manual(values = x_colors)+
  theme_minimal()
```


**2. Build an ANOVA model and display the summary output in your report.**
To build an anova model I simply used the code below
```{r echo=TRUE}
model <- aov(Salary ~ State + Rank + Tier, data = df)
# Print the ANOVA results
summary(model)
```


**3. The rest of the test uses another data set. The "Juniper_Oils.csv" data. Get it loaded and take a look. Then tidy it! (show the code used for tidying in your report)**
        
# Reading in the second dataset
```{r results=FALSE}
df2 <- read.csv("Juniper_Oils.csv")
```
After looking at the dataset and requested graph I figured that I need a column with each of the compounds and a column for concentration.
This tidying can be performed with one **pivot_longer** then I plotted it.
```{r}
df2 <- df2 %>% 
  pivot_longer(c("alpha.pinene","para.cymene","alpha.terpineol","cedr.9.ene","alpha.cedrene","beta.cedrene",
                 "cis.thujopsene","alpha.himachalene","beta.chamigrene","cuparene","compound.1","alpha.chamigrene",
                 "widdrol","cedrol","beta.acorenol","alpha.acorenol","gamma.eudesmol","beta.eudesmol","alpha.eudesmol",
                 "cedr.8.en.13.ol","cedr.8.en.15.ol","compound.2","thujopsenal"),
               names_to = "Chemical_Name", values_to = "Concentration")
```
**4. Make me a graph of the following:**

        x = YearsSinceBurn
        y = Concentration
        facet = ChemicalID (use free y-axis scales)
        
# Second Plot

```{r warning=FALSE}
ggplot(df2, aes(x=YearsSinceBurn, y=Concentration))+
  geom_smooth(size= 1.75)+
  theme_minimal()+
  facet_wrap(~Chemical_Name, scales = "free")
```

**5. Use a generalized linear model to find which chemicals show concentrations that are significantly (significant, as in P < 0.05) affected by "Years Since Burn".**

```{r warning=FALSE}
model <- glm(formula = Concentration ~ YearsSinceBurn + Chemical_Name, data = df2, family = gaussian)

# Extract and tidy the model coefficients
tidy_results <- tidy(model)

# Filter for significant results (p-value < 0.05)
significant_results <- tidy_results[tidy_results$p.value < 0.05, ]
significant_results
```

The "Chemical_Name" in front is ugly obviously so I got rid of that and we have our final dataframe.
```{r}
df3 <- significant_results %>% mutate(term = term %>% str_remove("Chemical_Name"))
# Print the significant results
print(df3)

```
